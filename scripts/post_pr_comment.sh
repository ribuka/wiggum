# Post exactly one issue-level comment to a pull request of this repository.
#
# This is a deliberately narrow wrapper around `gh pr comment`, meant to be
# handed to an agent (for example an external code-review agent) instead of
# raw `gh`/network access. Compared to calling `gh` directly, it:
#   - always targets the current checkout's own repository (derived from
#     `gh repo view`), so it cannot be pointed at an unrelated repository;
#   - only ever runs the single `gh pr comment` write action -- it has no
#     code path for editing/deleting comments, merging, closing, or
#     changing labels/reviewers;
#   - refuses to run unless the target PR actually exists in this repo;
#   - appends a fixed provenance footer itself, so the footer cannot be
#     omitted or altered by whatever produced the comment body.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/post_pr_comment.sh <pr-number> <body-file> <agent>
#
# <body-file> is the path to a text file containing the Markdown comment
# body. Use "-" to read the body from stdin instead.
#
# <agent> identifies which CLI agent produced the comment. It must be
# either "codex" or "claude"; the script records it in the footer itself
# so the caller cannot misreport which agent actually ran.
